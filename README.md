#### _Use arrays and looping to produce beeps and boops, March 2020_

#### By _**Stacey S**_

## Description

_This is a simple program to produce beeps and boops from certain number inputs. The background animation and the attempted button animation are from YouTube and other online tutorials/resources._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _The html file is the only web page file you will need._
* _CSS and JS files will also need to be downloaded. You may need to update the JS file referenced within the code, depending on which version you are running._

## Specs

In order of importance:

* _The program returns a rawnge of numbers from 0 to the user's inputted number._
    **Input:** 4
    **Output:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
* _Numbers that contain a 3 are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"_
    **Input:** 32
    **Output:** Won't you be my neighbor?
* _Numbers that contain a 2 are replaced with "Boop!"_
    **Input:** 21
    **Output:** Boop!
* _Numbers that contain a 1 are replaced with "Beep!"_
    **Input:** 14
    **Output:** Beep!
* _If the number does not contain a 1, 2, or 3 it will remain as is._
    **Input:** 5
    **Output:** 0, Beep!, Boop!, Won't you be my neighbor?, 4, 5

## Known Bugs

_The submit button refuses to actually use the animation that I want it to. Buttons and I never seem to get along in these projects, but otherwise it functions perfectly._
